--- Pandill0's Tweaks---
by GabeHasWon
commissioned by and designed by Pandill0

Pandill0's Tweaks is a (currently) small quality of life and content mod to change the game in small ways. It includes a couple of new critters, new fruits in trees, new vegetables that spawn in the ground, and a bunch of color consistency tweaks!
Alongside this, there's now a UI to choose world ores at spawn, a new mechanic for boss spawns, and even more to discover! This is also only the first version of the mod, with more on the way.
